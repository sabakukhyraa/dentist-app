The purpose of this project is to create a web application where dentists can keep notes about their patients and patients can access information about their dental health. The project aims to serve as a learning tool for backend development while providing a practical application scenario.

The web application will have two main user roles: dentists and patients. Dentists will be able to register, log in, and create patient profiles. Within these profiles, they can record notes about each patient's dental history, treatments, appointments, and any relevant medical information. They can also update and delete these records as needed.

On the other hand, patients will have limited access to the platform. They can only log in to view their own profiles which were created by their doctor and include details about their dental visits, treatments received, upcoming appointments, and general dental health advice provided by their dentists.
